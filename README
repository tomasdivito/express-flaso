An application made with express to send notifications to my application/(s?)
and be able to send ones to a db to then read in the app and have a thing like
an history of important events for people that couldn't watch the notifications

Other thing that probably have firebase but i want to do is the ability to
program notifications but doing other stuff to

Anyway i probably will be hitting the firebase api :P
